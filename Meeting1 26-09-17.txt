Had first meeting with Rem today
We discussed what he and Vivek hoped for me to be able to achieve over the course of the project
He discussed in detail and through the use of examples how the ASTRA programming language worked in terms of agents.
It is not compulsory for me to code the project through ASTRA but Rem would like me to try and thats fine with me
Rem also discussed the Sinbad project and how he wanted me to play around with it first before deciding how to procede
Rem has asked me to try to gain a basic understanding of ASTRA and Sinbad for when we next meet in a week's time
Vivek may also be present via Skype for this meeting.
